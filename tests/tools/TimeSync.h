/**
    Time Synchronization Protocol

    -- Motivation:

    Time synchronization is an important core component of an rUDP library,
    enabling multiple advantages over reliable UDP libraries without:

    (1) This specific (new) time synchronization works better over cellular
    networks than PTP/NTP.

    (2) The API provides time synchronization as a feature for applications,
    enabling millisecond-accurate dead reckoning for video games, and
    16-microsecond-accurate timing for scientific applications with 2-3 bytes.

    (3) Peer2Peer NAT hole-punch can be optimized because it can use time
    synchronization to initiate probes simultaneously on both peers.

    (4) Delay-based Congestion Control systems should use One Way Delay (OWD)
    on each packet as a signal, which allows it to e.g. avoid causing latency
    in realtime games while delivering a file transfer in the background.
    All existing Delay-based CC algorithms use differential OWD rather than
    proper time synchronization.  By adding time synchronization, CC becomes
    robust to changes in the base OWD as the end-points remain synced.

    -- Background:

    Network time synchronization can be done two ways:
    (a) Broadcast - Infeasible on the Internet and so not used.
    (b) Assuming that the link is symmetric, and trusting Min(RTT/2) = OWD.
    Meaning that existing network time synchronization protocols like NTP and
    PTP work by sending multiple probes, and then taking the probe with the
    smallest round trip time to be the best data to use in the set of probes.

    Time synchronization at higher resolutions needs to be performed constantly
    because clocks drift at a rate of about 1 millisecond per 10 seconds.
    So, a common choice for reliable UDP game protocols is to probe for time
    synchronization purposes (running NTP all the time) at a fixed interval of
    e.g. 5 to 10 seconds.

    The disadvantage of all of these existing approaches is that they only use
    a finite number of probes, and all probes may be slightly skewed,
    especially when jitter is present, or cross-traffic, or self-congestion
    from a file transfer.

    For cellular networks, existing time synchronization approaches provide
    degraded results due to the 4-10 millisecond jitter on every packet.
    "An End-to-End Measurement Study of Modern Cellular Data Networks" (2014)
    https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~bleong/publications/pam14-ispcheck.pdf

    when a link is asymmetrical there is no known practical method for
    performing time synchronization between two peers that meet on the Internet,
    so in that case a best effort is done, and at least it will be consistent.

    -- Algorithm:

    This TimeSync protocol overcomes this jitter problem by using a massive
    number of probes (every packet is a probe), greatly increasing the odds
    of a minimal RTT probe.

    How it works is that every packet has a 3 byte microsecond timestamp on it,
    large enough to prevent roll-over.  Both sides record the receive time of
    each packet as early as possible, and then throw the packet onto another
    thread to process, so that the network delay is more accurate and each
    client of a server can run in parallel.

    While each packet is being processed the difference in send and receive
    times are compared with prior such differences.  And a windowed minimum
    of these differences is updated.  Periodically this minimum difference
    is reported to the remote peer so that both sides have both the minimum
    (outgoing - incoming) difference and the minimum (incoming - outgoing)
    difference.

    These minimum differences correspond to the shortest trips each way.
    Effectively, it turns every single packet into a time synchronization
    probe, guaranteeing that it gets the best result possible.

    -- The (Simple) Math for TimeSync:

    We measure (Smallest C2S Delta) and (Smallest S2C Delta)
    through the per-packet timestamps.

        C2S = (Smallest C2S Delta)
            = (Server Time @ Client Send Time) + (C2S Propagation Delay) - (Client Send Time)
            = (C2S Propagation Delay) + (Clock Delta)

        S2C = (Smallest S2C Delta)
            = (Client Time @ Server Send Time) + (S2C Propagation Delay) - (Server Send Time)
            = (S2C Propagation Delay) - (Clock Delta)

        Such that (Propagation Delay) for each direction is minimized
        independently as described previously.

    We want to solve for (Clock Delta) but there is a problem:

    Note that in the definition of C2S and S2C there are three unknowns and
    only two measurements.  To resolve this problem we make the assumption
    that the min. propagation delays are almost the same in each direction.

    And so:

        (S2C Propagation Delay) approx equals (C2S Propagation Delay).

    Thus we can simply write:

        (Clock Delta) = (C2S - S2C) / 2

    This gives us 23 bits of the delta between clocks, since the division
    by 2 (right shift) pulls in an unknown high bit.  The effect of any
    link asymmetry is halved as a side effect, helping to minimize it.

    -- The (Simple) Math for Network Trip Time:

    It also provides a robust estimate of the "speed of light" between two
    network hosts (minimal one-way delay).  This information is then used to
    calculate the network trip time for every packet that arrives:

    Let DD = Distance from the current packet timestamp difference and minimal.
    DD = (Packet Receive - Packet Send) - Min(Packet Receive - Packet Send)
    Packet trip time = (Minimal one-way delay) + DD.
